# DEA_EIT
Research on the integration of dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) based pressure mapping technology.

This repository is mainly for storing data and the analysis code for:
1. DEA actuation
2. EIT-based mapping


The work carries on from the work seen in our [black_sensor](https://github.com/richgumy/black_sensor) repository
